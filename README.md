## What and why? 
### What? 
I propose to design and develop a comprehensive software system, "Personal Palette," that empowers users to cultivate a personalized skincare and cosmetics blueprint. This blueprint would be tailored meticulously to address and fit the individual needs and preferences of users. The components of the software system would primarily be the following: 

**1. Personal Profiling:**
Upon account creation, users will engage with a thorough yet intuitive survey questionnaire. Their responses will formulate distinctive skin types, highlight specific concerns, and map out individual beauty aspirations. 

**2. Smart Recommendations:**
The system's backbone, an algorithm that I intend to design, will sift through a database of a plethora of products. Then, this algorithm will curate and produce suggestions and recommendations for the user, determining the top-rated solutions aligned to their profile. 

**3. Price-Conscious Options:**
Beyond product recommendations, Personal Palette would be conscious of varied budgets. It would show users purchasing options of the recommended products, showing the most economical option of purchasing sites. 
   
**4. Cosmetic Curation:**
Users, who are eager to experiment with or refine their makeup style or skincare routine, will be provided with a tailored set of product suggestions and or routines to achieve their desired look. 

### Why? 
The cosmetic and skincare industry is saturated with an excessive amount of choices, often leading consumers down a path of confusion, wasted investments, and unmet expectations. Personal Palette intends to address this problem. It would offer clarity to users by ensuring that they not only find products that are suitable to their skin and beauty desires but also align with their financial comfort. Moreover, the need and relevance for personalization, especially for consumer goods, has become more important than ever. The significance of a software system that genuinely understands and caters to individual needs would be extensive. Personal Palette aims to revolutionize the user experience in the skincare and cosmetics domain, fusing the world of technology and AI with individual beauty aspirations. 

## For whom? 
Personal Palette would be designed for a diverse audience that spans from discerning individuals overwhelmed by the vast skincare and cosmetic markets to both novices and experts of beauty products. It would cater to budget-concious shoppers who are seeking the best value for their money, and would extend its reach to beauty communities where people of all ages engage in beauty discussions and exploration. The platform would cater to those passionate about personalized beauty care solutions that don't just have a "one size fits all" approach. It is one that truly recognizes that people all over the world have unique type of skin, as well as diverse concerns or preferences, that should be attended to with care. Ongoing engagement and feedback from the end-users will continue to refine and shape the software to be a revolution in its domain. 

## How? 
As mentioned above, the components implemented by Personal Palette would be Personal Profiling, Smart Recommendations, Price-Concious Options, and Cosmetic Curation. To further elaborate, from an end-user's vantage, Personal Palette would serve as an interactive guide to personalized beauty. Upon registration, the user would be guided through a questionnaire that cumulates an understanding of the user's skin and their concerns. Through this questionnaire, the software would gather insight into the user's skin type, their unique concerns, and cosmetic aspirations. Then, with this input, the software's algorithm would provide curated skincare and cosmetic product recommendations. It would also provide pricing options of the products on different purchasing sites, showing users the most economic choices. Additionally, users who desire to refine or revamp their makeup style will be able to select from a spectrum of aesthetic preferences. The software would respond to their selection with a detailed blueprint, suggesting products and routines aligned to their chosen style. At every step, Personal Palette would prioritize personalization, ensuring that each user's experience feels sincere and rewarding. 

## Scope 
The software's core components that would need to be implemented are the following: 
**1. User Registration and Profile Management**
A sign up/login functionality, as well as a user dashboard for managing personal details and preferences. This would also cover password reset and account recovery features. 

**2. Personalized Survey Modules**
Dynamic survey forms to gather the skin type, concerns, and preferences of the users, in addition to storage mechanisms. 

**3. Recommendation Algorithm**
Database of skincare and makeup products, with ratings, ingredients, and pricing.  The algorithm will have logic to match user responses with curated products and have a ranking mechanism to prioritize top rated products.

**4. Pricing Option Engine**
Integration with APIs to gather data on current product pricing from different retailers, functionality to compare prices and present most economical option.

**5. Data Security and Privacy**
Encryption protocols to ensure safety of user data, and compliance to privacy regulations.

**6. UI/UX**
Design of intuitive and responsive layouts for users, with user friendly navigation.

**7. Reporting/Analytics**
Functionality to analyze user interactions, popular products, and survey responses (optional on the developers' end).

**8. Mainentance**
Mechanisms for regular database updates regarding products and pricing.

If a team of 4-6 programmers were to take on 1-2 of these components each, this software would be challenging but feasible. It would combine many functionalities, from survey modules to recommendation algorithms to external pricing databases. I believe that it has a good ratio of complexity and achievability, which will make it a rewarding project to work on throughout a semester.
